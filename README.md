# fpga-accelerators
A compilation of all the tools and resources that one requires before they can run their own hardware accelerator on an FPGA. </br>
Our focus is on  documenting the flow of developing a hardware accelerator, starting right from training the neural network on a host all the way to detecting objects in real time from the webcam feed on a Xilinx KV260 FPGA. This will serve as a good starting point for all the embedded systems/ML enthusiasts who can't figure out a thing from the Vitis-AI documentation (literally me).
